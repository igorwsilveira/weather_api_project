# Project

This simple project is about a weather API, where I can send or receive data from a request, allowing me to search for weather data for more than two hundred thousand cities across the globe.Â 

The project it self doesn't contain interface yet, because I pretend to improvise my knowledge about API's and how they work with different services.

## ðŸ§° Tools

1. Python
2. OpenWeather API
